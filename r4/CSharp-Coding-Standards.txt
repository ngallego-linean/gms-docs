R4 Coding Standards

C# Coding Standards and Best Practices
Revision Date: September 10, 2025

R4 software development coding standards, guidelines, and best practices are based on
Microsoft C# Coding Standards and Code Complete, Second Edition.
Pascal Case: First character of all words is upper case, and other characters are
lower case.
Example: ClassName
Camel Case: First character of all words, except the first word, is upper case and
other characters are lower case.
Example: className

If you have any questions or doubts, please consult with the Systems Architect.

BASIC NAMING CONVENTIONS AND STYLES
When naming classes, methods, variables, and parameters, consideration
should be given to the other steps in the development process. You want to
keep the name simple and clear, but as short as possible.

CD-001
Use descriptive variable names.


Variable names should fully and accurately describe what the variable represents.



Use Camel case for variable names.



Do not use Hungarian notation (use age instead of intAge).



Variable names should focus on the problem rather than the solution, expressing
the “what“, more than the “how”.



Variable names should generally avoid abbreviations (e.g., use count instead of
Num).



Do not use single-character variable names, such as i or t. Use index or temp
instead. The only exceptions to this rule are when used for iterations in loops (i.e.,
for loops) and in LINQ queries.



For LINQ queries, single letter variables should be lower case and be the first
letter of the name of the object being selected from. For example: var users = from
u in Users select u;

Examples of good and poor variable names (from Code Complete, Second Edition, p. 261)

CD-002
Class Naming Guidelines


Use a noun or noun phrase to name a class, e.g., Facility or FacilityContact.



For names of custom attribute classes, use the suffix Attribute, e.g.,
AddUserAttribute.



For names of custom exception classes, use the suffix Exception, e.g.,



InventoryException.
For Interfaces, prefix the class name with ‘I’.

CD-003
Method Naming Guidelines


Name methods using a verb-object pair, such as ShowDialog().



Methods that return values should have a name describing the value returned,
such as GetObjectState().



Name methods using complete identifier names. Do not use
abbreviations/acronyms for identifier names.
Avoid: OnBtnClick or OnBtnClck
Correct: OnButtonClick

CD-004
Use “Pascal case” for type, method names, and constants.
public class ClassName
{
private const int DefaultSize = 100;
public SomeMethod()
{
}

}
CD-005
Use “Camel case” for local variable names and method arguments.
public void DoSomething (string someNumber)
{
int age;
float maxHeight;
float minWidth;
}
CD-006
Private member variables should use Pascal case and be prefixed with an underscore _.
public class ClassName
{
private string _FirstName;
private string _LastName;
private string _Address;
}
CD-007
Always use C# predefined types rather than the aliases in the System namespace.
object NOT Object
string NOT String
int
NOT Int32
double
NOT Double
bool NOT Boolean

Code Style
CD-100
The curly brace for a code block must always start on a new line after the construct
calling the code block.
public class ClassName
{
public SomeMethod()
{
}
}
CD-101
Always use a curly brace scope in an “if” statement, even if it contains only a single
statement.
//Avoid
if (isFound)
Process();

//Correct
if (isFound)
{
Process();
}

CD-102
Maintain uniform indentation throughout all code using Visual Studio’s default settings
(4-space indents, Allow Smart Indenting). Do not use nonstandard indentation, such as
one space.
CD-103
Code comments


Generally, well-structured and named code can be self-documenting; however,
always add comments to code that may have less obvious assumptions, special
algorithms, etc.



Always add XML comments to document the purpose of public reusable methods.



All methods in base classes must include XML comments for the purpose of the
method and for each method parameter.



Indent comments to the same level of indentation as the code you are
documenting.



All comments should pass spell checking. Misspelled comments indicate sloppy
development.



Avoid comments that explain the obvious. Code should be self-explanatory. Good
code with readable variable and method names should not require comments.

R4 Coding Standards: C# Coding Standards and Best Practices

/// <summary>
/// [Comments about your public class].
/// </summary>
public class ClassName
{
…
}
CD-104
Avoid fully qualified type names. Use the using statement instead. Group all framework
namespaces together and put custom or third-party namespaces underneath.
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;
using System.Data;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Collections.Specialized;
using R4;
using R4.Data;
using R4.Utilities;
using R4.AspNetCore.Mvc;
CD-105
Avoid putting a using statement inside a namespace.
CD-106
All member variables should be declared at the top of the class, with one line
separating them from the properties or methods.
public class ClassName
{
private int number;
private string name;
public void MethodName1()
{
…
}
public void MethodName2()
{

}

}

…

CD-107
Declare a local variable as close as possible to its first use (not all at the top of the
method).
CD-108
Use a single space before and after each operator.
//Avoid
string name=String.Empty;

//Correct
string name = String.Empty;

CD-109
Avoid using regions to hide the main code methods. Regions may be used to hide
constants or “helper” methods.
CD-110
Use a single space after keywords in control flow statements.
//Avoid
int Method()
{
if(a > b)
{
return 0;
}
return 3;
}

//Correct
int Method()
{
if (a > b)
{
return 0;
}
return 3;
}

CD-111
Use a single space within parentheses of expressions.
//Avoid
int Function(int a, int b)
{
return a * (b - a);
}

//Correct
int Function(int a, int b)
{
return a * ( b - a );
}

CD-112
Use a single space within argument list parentheses.
//Avoid
int Method()
{

Console.WriteLine("In
Method");
return 3;
Page 6 of 17

}
//Correct
int Method()
{

Console.WriteLine( "In Method"

);
}

return 3;

CD-113
Use single spaces inside parentheses for control flow statements.
//Avoid
int Method()
{
if (a > b)
{
return 0;
}
return 3;
}

//Correct
int Method()
{
if ( a > b )
{
return 0;
}
return 3;
}

CD-114
Use expression body for methods when on a single line.
CD-115
Use expression body for constructors when on a single line.
CD-116
Use expression body for properties when possible.
CD-117
Use expression body for indexers when possible.
CD-118
Use expression body for lambdas when possible.
CD-119
Use expression body for local functions when possible.
CD-120
Use expression body for indexers when possible.
CD-121
Use the var keyword to declare variables.
CD-122
Prefer auto properties (automatically generate get/set).
CD-123
Prefer pattern matching.
CD-124
Prefer pattern matching over ‘is’ with ‘cast’ check.
CD-125
Prefer pattern matching over ‘as’ with ‘null’ check.

Coding Best Practices
CD-200
Avoid methods with more than 500 lines. Break functionality up into multiple methods.
Always seek to generalize code for multiple uses.
CD-201
Avoid files with more than 2,000 lines (excluding machine-generated code)
CD-202
Lines should not exceed 120 characters.
CD-203
Avoid methods with more than five required arguments. Use structures for passing
multiple arguments.
CD-204
Methods containing more than three parameters should have their parameters broken
out into a parameter per line to improve readability. For example:
public IActionResult GetDataSourceResult(
[DataSourceRequest] DataSourceRequest request,
string name = null,
StringSearchOption nameSearchOption = StringSearchOption.Contains,
int? affiliationID = null,
int? programContactUserID = null,
int? developerContactUserID = null,
bool? requireRolesToAuthenticate = null,
AuthenticationScope? authenticationScope = null,
bool showOnlyAppsThatUserHasRightsTo = false
)
{
}

CD-205
Nameof should be used instead of string literals when throwing ArgumentException,
ArgumentNullException, or ArgumentOutOfRangeException and when wanting to
reference any variable and/or method name in a string.
//Avoid
public BaseContentWrapper(ViewContext viewContext)
{
if ( viewContext == null )
{
throw new ArgumentNullException( "viewContext" );
Page 11 of 17

Commission on Teacher Credentialing
R4 Coding Standards: C# Coding Standards and Best Practices

}

}

ViewContext = viewContext;
Writer = viewContext.Writer;

//Correct
public BaseContentWrapper(ViewContext viewContext)
{
if ( viewContext == null )
{
throw new ArgumentNullException( nameof( viewContext ) );
}

}

ViewContext = viewContext;
Writer = viewContext.Writer;

CD-206
Except for zero and one, never hard-code a numeric value; always declare a constant
instead. Constants should be placed near the top of the class declaration.
CD-207
Use the const directive only on natural constants such as the number of days in a week.
Do not hardcode numbers.
public const int DaysInWeek = 7;

CD-208
Do not manually edit any machine-generated code.
CD-209
Avoid putting multiple classes in a single file.
CD-210
A single file should contribute types to only a single namespace. Avoid having multiple
namespaces in the same file.
CD-211
Catch only exceptions for which you have explicit handling.
CD-212
Do not catch an exception and throw the same exception without doing something
(such as logging) with the caught exception first.
CD-213

R4 Coding Standards: C# Coding Standards and Best Practices

Avoid error codes as method return values.
CD-214
Apply the correct modifiers to classes/methods/properties/fields.
CD-215
Make only the most necessary types public, mark others as internal.
CD-216
Avoid function calls in Boolean conditional statements. Assign to local variables and
check on them.
//Method
private bool IsEverythingOK()
{
…
}
//Avoid
if ( IsEverythingOK() )
{
…
}

//Correct
bool everythingIsOk = IsEverythingOK();
if ( everythingIsOk )
{
…
}

CD-217
Always use zero-based arrays.
CD-218
Always explicitly initialize an array of reference types using a for loop.
CD-219
Do not provide public or protected member variables. Use properties instead.
CD-220
Avoid using the new inheritance qualifier; use override instead.
CD-221
Never use unsafe code, except when using COM interop.
CD-222
Avoid explicit casting when possible. Use the as operator to cast to a type defensively.
CD-223
Always check a delegate for null before invoking it.
CD-224
Do not provide public event member variables. Use event accessors instead.

CD-225
Use String.Empty to represent empty strings rather than “”.
//Avoid
string name = “”;

//Correct
string name = String.Empty;

CD-226
When building a long string, use StringBuilder, not string.
CD-227
Use string interpolation instead of catenation for short strings.
CD-228
Do not use the this keyword unless invoking another constructor from within a
constructor, or explicitly invoking an extension method on the current type.
CD-229
Never hardcode strings/numbers that might change based on deployment. These values
should be placed into a configuration file.
CD-230
Use Entity Framework for data access. This will help ensure consistency and
maintainability among all systems.
CD-231
String variables can be null, so it is always a good idea to use the
String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace() method when testing to determine if a string is empty or
null.
CD-232
A method should only do “one job”. Do not combine more than one job in a single
method, even if those jobs are very small.
//Avoid
//Save the address and send an email
SaveAddress (address, emailAddress);
void SaveAddress (string address, string emailAddress)
{
//job 1 – save the address
…

}

//job 2 – send the email
…

//Correct

//Save the address
SaveAddress (address);
//Send the email
SendEmail (address, emailAddress);

void SaveAddress (string address)
{
//save the address
…
}
void SendEmail (string address, string emailAddress)
{
//send the email
…
}

CD-232
Use an enum instead of numbers or strings to indicate discrete values.
//Avoid
void SendEmail (string emailMessage, string emailType)
{
switch (emailType)
{
case “HTML”:
//do something
break;
case “PlainText”:
//do something
break;
default:
//do something
break;
}
}
//Correct
enum EmailType
{
Html,
PlainText
}
void SendEmail (string emailMessage, EmailType emailType)
{
switch (emailType)
{
case EmailType.Html:
//do something
break;
case EmailType.PlainText:
//do something
break;
default:
//do something
break;
}
}

CD-233
Avoid conditions with double negatives. Although the negative property does make
sense, overriding it with a “not” can make the code unreadable.
//Avoid
bool hasNoExpenditures = true;
if ( hasNoExpenditures )…

//Correct
bool hasExpenditures = false;
if ( !hasExpenditures )…

CD-234
Do not leave commented-out code in files. Generally, use the source control commit
history to review changes to a file.
