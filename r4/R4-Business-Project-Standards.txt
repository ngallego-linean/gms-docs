R4 Solution Architecture: Business Project

R4 Solution Architecture

Business Project
Revision Date: October 16, 2025

Every R4 application’s Visual Studio solution is composed of at least five projects as explained in the R4
Visual Studio Solution Architecture document. The business services layer plays a very important and
significant role in an application which is providing the business logic to the application.
The business services layer (aka business logic Layer) is a central application programming interface (API)
containing business logic code that presentation (web user interface [UI], Windows/console
applications) and non-presentation (SOAP/REST web services, Windows services, daemons, etc.) layers
share. This design improves maintainability, allows multiple presentation and non-presentation layers to
implement the same business logic, as well as ensures a consistent approach in which business logic is
validated and executed.
It is very important that code is written in the Business project that validates all business rules as well as
data requirements (checking to ensure appropriate fields have values, fields do not have empty strings,
etc.) to ensure data integrity. While it may be important to have user interface validation that provides
an intuitive and thoughtful user experience, the same validation must be implemented in the business
services layer for non-presentation layers. Remember, the user interface is just one way to save data to
a database.
In summary, this design allows a web page and a REST web service endpoint to create an entity using
the same business rule validation and processing code.

Contact Management System (CMS) Implementation Example (Case Study)
You may have a web application that allows creating and editing contact records in a database. One of
the business rules that you must implement is to ensure that you can only have one contact record for a
given email address. You must also provide a Web API REST web service endpoint that allows creation
and editing of contacts from an Android or iOS mobile application.

You will want to write this business logic code in one place so it can be reused by both the web
application as well as the Web API REST web service. Below is a diagram of the architecture of the
fictious Contact Management System application.

Please note that the details of the below high-level steps are discussed in other documentation.
In the Business project, implement the following high-level steps:







Create a ContactService class and register it in the business services framework.
Add a SaveAsync method to the ContactService class that accepts an instance of a Contact model
class that was either generated by Entity Framework (data model) or created manually (domain
model) and returns an instance of a BusinessServiceOperationResult class.
Within the Save method, add code to test for the existence of another Contact record that has
the same email address property value as the Contact to be created or edited.
o If another Contact is found for the same email address, then add an error message to
the BusinessServiceOperationResult instance to be returned to the Save methods caller.
o If no other contact is found the email address, then save the Contact to the database
using the appropriate Repository.
Return the instance of the BusinessServiceOperationResult class that may or may not contain
error messages.

In the MVC Web Application, implement the following high-level steps to connect to the Business
project:




In the controller action methods for the HTTP POST operations for both CreateAsync and
EditAsync of Contacts, invoke the SaveAsync method of the ContactService and pass the instance
of the Contact class to either create or update the record.
If the BusinessServiceOperationResult result from the Save method contains errors, then add the
errors to the ModelState dictionary so that the user is informed of any business rule infractions.
If there are no errors, then redirect back to the Details action method.

In the Web API REST Web Service, implement the following high-level steps to connect to the Business
Service:





In controller action methods for the HTTP POST operations for both CreateAsync and EditAsync
of Contacts, invoke the SaveAsync method of the ContactService and pass the instance of the
Contact class to either create or update.
If the BusinessServiceOperationResult result from the Save method contains errors, then return
an HTTP 500 result, along with a result that explains the error(s) contained within the
BusinessServiceOperationResult class. If there are no errors, then return appropriate success
result.

In the case study above, it should be fairly evident that both the MVC (UI) and Web API controller action
methods are just facilitating the process getting the data from the Views/Pages, mapping the data to the
Contact object, and then passing off to the business services layer’s ContactService to be validated and
saved.

Project Contents
A R4 Business Services Class Library project (naming standards) will be established for you during the
initial solution creation process initiated by the System Architect and will be ready for you before you
begin development efforts. The project you will receive will provide the following composition:
Folder/Node Name

Description

Dependencies

Contains project-level resources and references such as R4 framework
assemblies and references to other projects in the solution.

Business

Includes the [Acronym]BusinessServiceManager class and
I[Acronym]BusinessServiceManager interface, both contain properties to
reference the business services classes defined in the Business\Services
folder.

Business\Services

Folder contains base BusinessService classes, (e.g. [Acronym]BusinessService),
and a service class for each business entity, deriving from
[Acronym]BusinessService.

Guidelines





(SA-100) Typically, use a business service class per table/entity.
(SA-101) Organize business services by clustering them into the appropriate application’s

functional aspect/module.
o Typically, a left navigation item in a Web UI project would be considered a module.
(SA-102) Data Repositories must only be accessed directly from within a business service.
Methods must be written in the business service class that allows for both getting data from and
putting data into the database. Typically, a business service class will have the following
methods:
o EntitySearch
o Search



(SA-103) All Business Service methods that would either create/update or delete data in the



database must have a return type of Ctc.R4.Business.BusinessServiceOperationResult.
(SA-104) All string messages returned by a business services class must be stored in a Resource
(RESX) file and not hard coded.

Naming Standards
Business Project Folder Naming






(SA-105) A separate folder (namespace) should be created for each application module.
(SA-106) Use plural names.
(SA-107) Avoid abbreviations.
(SA-108) Use Pascal Case (first letter in the first word and the first letter of each subsequent

concatenated word are capitalized).
(SA-109) Use alphanumeric characters only.

Good Folder Name Examples
Documents
Employees
Contacts

Poor Folder Name Examples
Document
Emp
ContactServices

Business Service Class Naming








(SA-110) Each database entity/table in that module should have its own business service class

except for Static Value Tables (SVTs).
(SA-111) The name of each business service class should be the name of the entity/table suffixed
with the word “Service”.
(SA-112) The SVT business service should be named StaticValueService.cs.
(SA-113) Avoid abbreviations.
(SA-114) Use Pascal Case (first letter in the first word and the first letter of each subsequent
concatenated word are capitalized).
(SA-115) Use alphanumeric characters only.
(SA-116) Use singular names.

Good Class Name Examples
ContactService.cs
DocumentService.cs
StaticValueService.cs

Poor Class Name Examples
ContactsService.cs
DocService.cs
SVTService.cs

Method Naming


(SA-117) Method names should follow verb-noun naming conventions unless the noun would be



redundant to the class name.
(SA-118) Use Pascal Case (first letter in the first word and the first letter of each subsequent
concatenated word are capitalized).
