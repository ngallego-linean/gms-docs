If a View has a type specified for the model, the type (@model [Type]) should always be
a ViewModel (POCO classes that are not Entity Framework model classes, but may
contain them), except if it is a Partial View, EditorTemplate, or DisplayTemplate.
CD-401
Every Controller should at least have an Action Method and View named Index.
CD-402
Avoid using HTML element IDs that contain the element type.

//Avoid
<div id=”divLeftNav”></div>

//Correct
<div id=”LeftNavPanel”></div>

When designing HTML Helper extension methods that generate and return HTML,
methods should return the IHtmlContent type.
public static IHtmlContent StandardAddress(this IHtmlHelper helper) { }

CD-404
When designing HTML Helper extension methods that generate and write HTML,
methods should return void and be prefixed with “Render”. For example:
