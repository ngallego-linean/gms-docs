Commission on Teacher Credentialing
R4 Framework: Standard Permission Groups and Roles

Standard Permission Groups and
Roles
Revision Date: October 16, 2025
The following permission groups and roles are included in all Commission applications
and should be used as specified below. These permissions groups and roles cannot be
changed and are included and implemented in the R4 framework. Additional custom
roles and groups may need to be created to handle situations such as entity-level data
and/or to control access to restricted/confidential data. For assistance, contact your
supervisor or the Systems Architect.

Standard Permission Roles


AppAdmin. Users with this role are typically the Business Leads for the
applications and have full read/write access to all parts of the application except
for 1) user access (configure using the UserAccessAdmin role), 2) IT-related
configuration and management functions (configure using the ITAdmin role) and
3) confidential/sensitive information (secured with a separate role). Typically, the
AppAdmin role would have read/write access to all entity-level user interfaces.



ControlPanelAdmin. Users with this role have access to the applications control
panel.



GlobalViewer. Users with this role (typically internal Commission staff) can
perform read-only viewing of ALL portions of an application except those parts
involving confidential/sensitive data, where a separate explicit specific role(s) will
need to be created. This role should not be added to entity-level user interfaces
where the entity-level data/records are considered sensitive.



ITAdmin. This role is intended for portions of the application that should only
have read/write access by IT Project Managers and developers. In general, all IT
Admin user interfaces should include GlobalViewer rights to enable those in the
ITGlobalViewers group to view these



UserAccessAdmin. Users with this role have read/write access to all user
interfaces involving establishing and managing user access. This role should be
used very narrowly, only for pages related to user access administration.
