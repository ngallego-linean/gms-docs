First Name

For people with a single name, first
name is not required. Field help should
direct such users to the LastName field.
Required field unless business practices
indicate otherwise.
This field contains either the Street
address or Post Office Box. Normally
the company name and/or company
subunit name should be captured as
one or two separate fields to ensure the
StreetAddress field is a separate and
last line of the mailing address before

users. A generic shared utility should
format the phone number for display
purposes.

outlined in RFC 3696.
