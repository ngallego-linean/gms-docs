R4 Solution Architecture: MVC Project

R4 Solution Architecture

ASP.NET Core Shared Project
Revision Date: October 16, 2025

Every R4 application’s Visual Studio solution is composed of at least five projects as explained in the R4
Visual Studio Solution Architecture document. The AspNetCore MVC project provides application
specific base controllers (e.g. [AppAcronym]Controller), view models and extension methods that can be
consumed by all user interface (UI) projects in a R4 application’s solution. The resources in this project
are only available to UI projects in a R4 solution and are only relevant to the presentation layer.

Project Contents
A R4 AspNetCore MVC project will be established for you during the initial solution creation process
initiated by the System Architect and will be ready for you before you begin development efforts. The
project you will receive will provide the following composition:
Folder/Node Name

Description

Dependencies

Contains project-level resources and references such as R4 framework
assemblies and references to other projects in the solution.

AspNetCore/Mvc/
ViewModels

This folder includes all the view models that will be used on pages/views
and grids in the Web UI projects.

[AppAcronym]Controller.cs

The controller that all other controllers inherit from.

Business

This folder includes extension classes that are used to add search code
for search views and grids. The methods in these extension classes can be
used all UI projects.

Guidelines


(SA-100) Create a folder under the ViewModels folder for each database table/entity that will



have its own page/view in a UI project.
(SA-100) Create a separate view model class per table/entity that will have its own page/view in
a UI project and organize the view models in the correct folders.

Naming Standards
View Models


(SA-110) Each database entity/table that will have its own page/view in a UI project should have



its own view model class except for Static Value Tables (SVTs). SVTs should not have UI that
allows users to update the values in these tables.
(SA-111) The name of each view model class should be the name of the entity/table suffixed with
the word “ViewModel”.
(SA-113) Avoid abbreviations.
