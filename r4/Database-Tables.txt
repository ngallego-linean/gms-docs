Database Tables

Revision Date: September 10, 2025
Database tables meet business needs for the data that you are collecting. The main goal
of adopting table naming and design standards is so that you and others can easily
identify the purpose of the tables contained in the database.
If you have any questions or doubts, please consult with your supervisor, the Systems
Architect, or the DBA.

SCHEMA NAMING
When naming database schemas, consideration should be given to the
other steps in the development process. Use schemas to organize tables
into related groups of information, e.g., Human Resources, Asset
Management, etc.
DB-100
Schema names must meet the following criteria:








Use abbreviations.
Singular
Use lowercase only.
Use alpha characters only.
Less than 40 characters
Avoid SQL reserved words (there may be some exceptions)
Do not use prefixes such as “sch” or “s”.

Good Schema Name Examples
hr
am
ec

Poor Schema Name Examples
HumanResources
assetMgmt
EC

TABLE NAMING
When naming database tables, consideration should be given to the
other steps in the development process. Keep in mind that you will most

likely have to use the names you give to your tables several times as part
of other objects, such as procedures, triggers, or views, which may all
contain references to the table name. You want to keep the name simple
and straightforward, but as short as possible.
DB-101
Table names must meet the following criteria:




Descriptive
Avoid abbreviations.
Singular
Use Pascal Case (first letter in the first word and the first letter of each subsequent
concatenated word are capitalized)
Use alphanumeric characters only
Less than 128 characters
Avoid SQL reserved words (there may be some exceptions)
Do not use prefixes such as “tb” or “tbl”

Good Table Name Examples
Customer
Employee
Institution
ProgramApprovalStatus

Poor Table Name Examples
CCType
Emp
Inst
PAStatus

DB-102
For tables that handle many-to-many relationships, the same naming standards apply.
The table should be named by concatenating the names of the tables that have a one-tomany relationship with the join table.
For example, you might have "Doctor" and "Patient" tables. Since doctors can have
many patients and patients can have many doctors (specialists) you need a table to
hold the data for those relationships in a junction table. This table should be
named “DoctorPatient".

COLUMN NAMING
When naming columns, keep in mind that they are members of the table
and do not need any mention of the table name in the column name.
When writing a query against more than one table, you should prefix
the field name with the table name (or table alias, if required) anyway.

DB-103
Field names must meet the following criteria:


Descriptive and unambiguous.



Avoid abbreviations.



Singular.



Use Pascal Case (first letter in the first word and the first letter of each subsequent
concatenated word are capitalized).



Only use alphanumeric characters.



Less than 128 characters.



Avoid SQL reserved words.



Avoid prefixes such as “fld” or “col” or data types (intCustomerID).



Avoid using the table name in field names. (For a table named Department,
instead of using a field name of DepartmentName, use Name).



Avoid the use of acronyms in field names unless the acronyms are well known.

Good Field Name Examples
FirstName
TonsPerDay
StatusChangedOn
FormNumber

Poor Field Name Examples
FName
tonsDay
StatusChangedDateTime
FormNum

CONSTRAINTS
DB-104
Primary keys must always be named “Id”.
DB-105
Foreign keys are named “Id” prefixed with the name of the foreign key’s parent table.
PK: Id (in table named Company)
FK Parent Table Name: Contact
FK: ContactId

DB-106
Use an additional meaningful prefix if the foreign key is used more than once in a table.
PK: Id (in table named Company)
FK Parent Table Name: Contact
FK1: BillingContactId
FK2: ShippingContactId

DB-107
When a foreign key’s parent table name includes the primary table’s name, the foreign
key name can be shortened to avoid redundancy, assuming it does not create ambiguity
about the foreign key’s parent table.
PK: Id (in table named Application)
FK Parent Table Name: ApplicationStatusSVT
FK1: StatusId (instead of ApplicationStatusId)

BIT FIELDS

DB-108
Prefix with “Is” (if this prefix is awkward, use some other prefix that clearly indicates
what a true value means, e.g., Can, Has, etc.).
DB-109
Avoid negative boolean names such as “IsNotValid”. Double negatives are hard to read
and understand when checking values in T-SQL (“not IsNotValid”).

DATETIME FIELDS
DB-110
Suffix field names with “On” (e.g., StatusChangedOn instead of StatusChangedDate)
DB-111
Always use the datetime data type. Consult with the Systems Architect or the DBA if you
feel there is a compelling reason to use a different date/time datatype.

COMMON DATA FIELDS

Archiving records means the record is not visible in systems unless searched for by the
user. The record is never deleted from the database table. Archived records by default
do not show up in searches, reports, or file counts. They can be searched and restored if
needed. Any table that requires the archived fields must include the following four
fields:

DB-114
All tables must include five (5) metadata fields to keep track of who created and
updated the record and when it was created and updated. The fields must be required
and must be the last fields in the table in the order shown below. The datetime fields
must have default values.

If a table has a list of lookup values that are foreign keys in other tables and the table is
not a Static Value Table (SVT), then the table must have the following fields in the order
listed below. These tables can have a UI in the system, allowing users to make changes

DB-116
See the Data Types page for a list of all SQL Server data types that can be used for
columns.
DB-117
All tables must have a primary key (PK), even if it is not actively used.
DB-118
Primary keys should generally use the database's auto-incrementing feature and be of
type “int”.
DB-119
Character-based primary keys should be avoided.
DB-120
If you have a choice, do not store binary or image files (Binary Large Objects or BLOBs)
inside the database. Retrieving and manipulating these large binary files is better
performed outside the database.
DB-121

Do not use TEXT or NTEXT datatypes for storing extensive textual data. Use the
maximum allowed characters of varchar(max) instead. NTEXT, TEXT, and IMAGE
data types will be deprecated in future SQL Server versions.
DB-122
Use the CHAR data type only if the column is fixed length and is not nullable (required).
If a char(200) field is nullable (not required), 200 bytes will be wasted if that field is
NULL. If the field can be nullable, use varchar instead.
DB-123
Always store years as four digits instead of two digits.

INDEXES
Like an index in a book, an index in a database lets you quickly find
specific information in a table or indexed view. An index contains keys
built from one or more columns in the table, or view, and pointers that
map to the storage location of the specified data. You can significantly
improve the performance of database queries and systems by creating
well-designed indexes to support your queries. Indexes can reduce the
amount of data that must be read to return the query result set. Indexes
can also enforce uniqueness on the rows in a table, ensuring the data
integrity of the table data (Microsoft Docs).
DB-124
It is good practice to index columns that are frequently used in a query's selection
criteria. Build an index for:
