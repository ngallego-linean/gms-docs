R4 Solution Architecture: Core Library Project

R4 Solution Architecture

Core Library Project
Revision Date: October 16, 2025

Every R4 application’s Visual Studio solution is composed of at least five projects as explained in the R4
Visual Studio Solution Architecture document. The Core Library project provides access to domain
models, enumerations, constants, and resources that can be consumed by other projects in a R4
application’s solution.
The Core Library project has resources that are available to all projects in a R4 solution. Some of the
resources in this project include domain models, email templates, enumerations, and project
configurations.

Project Contents
A R4 Core Library project will be established for you during the initial solution creation process initiated
by the System Architect and will be ready for you before you begin development efforts. The project you
will receive will provide the following composition:
Folder/Node Name

Description

Dependencies

Contains project-level resources and references such as R4 framework
assemblies and references to other projects in the solution.

DomainModels

This folder contains domain models that are not entity specific, or custom
domain models that are used to facilitate a batch operation, e.g. creating
multiple entities during the same transaction. For example, creating an
“Organization” and a “Contact” from a single page.

DomainModels\Entity

This folder contains the entity-specific domain models that map to the database
entities (database entities are typically scaffolded by EF).

Enumerations.cs

This document has a list of all enumerations typically one for each static value
table (SVT) in the database.

See also Domain Model Standards.
