R4 Database Standards

Database Functions
Revision Date: September 10, 2025

Functions are routines that accept parameters, perform an action, such as a complex
calculation, and return the result of that action as a value. The return value can either be
a single scalar value or a result set.
In most cases, database functions will not be necessary when developing R4 projects. If
you believe your project needs to use a database function, please consult with your
supervisor or the System Architect.

FUNCTION NAMING
DB-500
Function names must meet the following criteria:








Descriptive
Avoid abbreviations
Singular
Use Pascal Case (first letter in the first word and the first letter of each subsequent
concatenated word are capitalized)
Only use alphanumeric characters
Less than 40 characters
Avoid SQL reserved words

Good Function Name Examples
CalculateReviewDate
GetInstitutionCount
GetTotalEmployeeCount
CheckApplicationSubmission

Poor Function Name Examples
fnCalcReviewDate
GetInstitutionCnt
TotalEmpCount
ChkAppSubmission

FUNCTION DESIGN
DB-501
Use uppercase for all SQL keywords (SELECT, WHERE, AND, OR, LIKE).
DB-502
Indent code to improve readability.

DB-503
Use parentheses to increase readability.
WHERE (ApplicationStatusID = 1 AND (AddressTypeID = 1 OR AddressTypeID = 2))
DB-504
Use spaces so that expressions read like sentences.
ApplicationStatusID = 1, not ApplicationStatusID=1
DB-505
Do not use SELECT *. Using column names instead of “*” results in reduced disk I/O and
better performance.
DB-506
Only use table aliases when required by SQL.
DB-507
Only use field aliases when required by SQL.
DB-508
Fully qualify table names in JOINs (dbo.TableName).

PERMISSIONS
DB-509
Grant “execute” permissions to the it_application role for all functions.

SCHEMABINDING
DB-510
When creating a function, use SCHEMABINDING to bind the function to the schema of
the underlying table or tables. When SCHEMABINDING is specified, a warning will
display when changing the design of the tables used in the function. For example, if a
table has three columns and all the columns are being used in the function, deleting
one of the columns in the table will result in a warning listing all the functions that are
bound to the schema.
Also, when SCHEMABINDING is specified, the underlying tables cannot be deleted
before the function is updated or deleted.

To create a function using SCHEMABINIDING, add WITH SCHEMABINDING after the
parameters and before the “AS”.
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.[fnFunctionName]
(
@ParameterName int
)
RETURNS [datatype]
WITH SCHEMABINDING
AS
