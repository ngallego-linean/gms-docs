Main Layout for Applications
The main layout of software projects is established within the R4 framework and is not
included in each Visual Studio project. The main layout is referenced either in
_AppLayout view (~/Views/Shared/_AppLayout.cshtml).
Layout = Html.R4().MvcConfiguration.UserInterface.Layout.View;

App Layout
Each software project utilizes a project-specific layout (typically
~/Views/Shared/_AppLayout.cshtml) that provides content for regions defined in the
Main Layout as described above. These sections are defined as:




Header
Scripts
PageContentHeader

Discuss with the Systems Architect before making significant changes to the App Layout.

UI Guidelines
Several R4 UI extensions have been created to simplify the HTML markup of views.
(UI-200) For Create, Edit, and Details views, use “col-md-10 col-lg-8” to set the width of the

page. Other views can use “col-xs-12”.

Checkboxes



R4 Extension: Html.R4().Kendo().LabelSwitchFor
(UI-201) Use checkboxes to allow users to select one or more options.

CRUD Forms






(UI-202) Organize logically.
(UI-203) If any form elements are required, be sure to indicate them by setting the

[Required] attribute on the property in the Domain Model. The required mark (*)
will only be visible on Create and Edit views.
(UI-204) Group similar data using fieldsets. There should be a minimum of two
fieldsets on a page; otherwise, a fieldset is not needed.
(UI-205) Action buttons must be in the card footer below the form.








(UI-206) If the form is long enough to warrant at least half a page’s worth of

scrolling, then the buttons should also be placed within the card header as well as
the card footer.
(UI-207) In general, forms should be short and simple with concise text in limited
quantities. Users will rarely read extensive text.
(UI-208) Use RadioButtons and CheckBoxes correctly. A collection of radio boxes
indicates to select only one option from many, while checkboxes indicate to check
one or more options.
(UI-209) Forms should never return a server error when submitted with empty
fields.

Drop Down Lists


(UI-210) On Search pages, the default/first value in the dropdown list should say

“—Unspecified--” (plural). On Create and Edit pages, the default/first value in the
dropdown list should say “Select [Entity]…” (singular).
For example, a dropdown list displaying a status on a Search page will have the
default/first value of “--Unspecified--”. The same status dropdown on a Create or
Edit page will have the default/first value of “Select Status…”.

Export to Excel
The Export to Excel feature is a standard utility used in conjunction with data displays in
grids. When exported, data in the spreadsheet should resemble its display in the grid.
There are commonly more columns of data in the GridViewModel than are displayed in a
grid. The export should include all data in the GridViewModel. Use the mdi-file-excel
icon on the button, followed by the words Export to Excel.


Column order
o Column 1: RowId
o Column 2-n: columns from the grid
o Columns n+1-m: any additional columns from the grid view model
Note: The framework will ensure RowId is always first, and that IsArchived is
always last



Column names
o Column names should always be proper-case, and full words, not
abbreviations.
 Use [Display( Name = “…”)] in the ViewModel to create proper-case
column names

Fieldsets
Fieldsets allow you to group related controls within a form. Grouping controls makes it
easier for users to understand the purpose of the controls while simultaneously
facilitating tabbing navigation for visual user agents and speech navigation for speechoriented user agents (accessibility)—group similar data using fieldsets. There should be a
minimum of two fieldsets on a page; otherwise, a fieldset is not needed.

Grids


(UI-211) Generally, grids should allow sorting, paging, and export to Excel unless



there is a valid reason not to have these grid features enabled.
(UI-212) Hyperlink all email addresses to the actual email address
Avoid
amunguia@ctc.ca.gov



Correct
amunguia@ctc.ca.gov

(UI-213) If there are no records to display in the grid, use the

[GridName]NoGridRecordsTemplate script to display a message saying, “There are
no [entities] to display.”. For example, a document's grid with no records to
display would say “There are no documents to display.”. Make sure to use the
correct grammar and spelling.

Images








(UI-214) Always include an “alt” attribute in an image tag.
(UI-215) Keep the “alt” text short but descriptive.
(UI-216) Include longer descriptions in the context of the document.
(UI-217) Alternate text should communicate the purpose of the image.
(UI-218) Provide empty or null “alt” text for images that do not convey content.
(UI-219) Do not repeat the “alt” text of an image in the adjacent text.
(UI-220) Leaving the “alt” attribute out of the image tag is not the same as setting

the “alt” attribute to an empty string (alt=””). If the “alt” attribute is left out of the
image tag, some screen readers will read the file name of the image. For images
that do not convey content (decorative images such as rounded corners) set the
“alt” attribute to an empty string (alt=””).

Labels
Using the R4 Extension, the label will render with the “for” attribute, allowing screen
readers to associate the appropriate label with the proper form element (textbox,
textarea, checkbox, etc.). Using the “for” attribute of a label also allows the user to click
on the label itself to set focus to the form element.




R4 Extension: LabelFor
(UI-221) If the R4 Extension is not used, then the “for” attribute must be added to
the label manually.
<label for=”FirstName”>First Name</label>

Links





(UI-222) Avoid long links. Links should be long enough to convey the purpose of

the link.
(UI-223) Avoid non-informative link phrases such as
o click here
o here
o more
o read more
o info
(UI-224) Links are helpful when the text makes sense out of context.
Avoid
click here to access today’s weather

Correct
today’s weather

Lists


(UI-225) Unordered lists (<ul>) should be used when there is no order of sequence



or importance.
(UI-226) Order lists (<ol>) should be used when there is a sequence.

Page Title






R4 Extension: R4().PageInfoTitle
(UI-227) Set the title of the page in the controller, above the action method name,
using the [PageInfo] attribute.
(UI-228) Use the first argument of the PageInfoTitle method (subTitle) to display
the entity name. The subTitle is used primarily on pages with tabs to display the
name of the entity.
(UI-229) Any page that is displaying sub/child entity information should have the
parent entity type in the page title. For example, Address, Contacts, Documents,
Notes, and Communications in most cases are sub/child entities of a parent entity.
These pages should have the parent entity type in the page title, followed by the
page name.
Company Addresses
Company Address Details

Company Edit Address
Company Add Address
Company Documents
In this example, Company is the parent entity type.

Radio Buttons



(UI-230) Use radio buttons to allow users to select one option from many.
(UI-231) If you are using an HTML radio button (input type=”radio”), then use an

HTML label (<label>) and set the “for” attribute of the label to the “id” attribute of
the radio button.

Search Filters







(UI-232) Use a Filter button to display the off-canvas sidebar with search filters.

The filter should be an extra small button (btn-xs) with the “mdi-filter-outline”
icon to the left of the word “Filter”. The filter button should be right-aligned in the
grid’s ToolBar header parallel to the “Create [Entity]” and “Export To Excel”
buttons.
(UI-233) Organize logically.
(UI-234) The “search” button should be right-aligned in the off-canvas sidebar. The
text on the button should say “Search” and use the “mdi-magnify” icon. The search
button should use the “primary” background color.
(UI-235) A reset button should be added to the right of the search button with the
text “Reset”. This button should reset the controls to their original setting. This
button should use the “mdi-refresh” icon. The reset button should use the
“secondary” background color.

Switches (Yes/No)
There are a couple of different use cases for capturing Yes/No or True/False data values
in user interfaces. Depending on the requirements and needs, several approaches can be
used to design the user interface.




(UI-236) If True/False OR NULL are used on a data entry screen (Edit/Create page,

etc.), then use radio buttons or drop-downs (depends on what looks better)
(UI-237) If True/False are the only options on any screen (Search, Edit, Create page,
etc.), then use the Telerik Switch control.
(UI-238) If True/False OR NULL and used on a Search page (null option generally
used for "No Filter Value"), then use a dropdown (see Archived dropdown in
existing R4 apps).

Tables











(UI-239) Do not use tables for page layouts.
(UI-240) For tables displaying data, the table should be wrapped inside a div and

the div should use the “table-responsive” class.
(UI-241) Use the “summary” attribute of the table to include a description of a data
table.
(UI-242) Provide a name/title for data tables using the “<caption>” tag,
immediately after the opening “<table>” tag.
(UI-243) The header row should be inside a <thead> tag.
(UI-244) Use “<th>” for the column headings.
(UI-245) Use the “scope” attribute (scope=”col”) of the “<th>” tag to tell the browser
and screen reader that everything under the column is related to the column
header.
(UI-246) All other rows should be inside a <tbody> tag.
(UI-247) The “scope” attribute (scope=”row”) can also be used on a row to tell the
browser and screen reader that everything in the row is related to the row
header.
<div class="table-responsive">
<table class="table table-hover table-condensed" summary="……">
<caption>Publications by Status</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col">Status</th>
<th scope="col" class="text-right">Count</th>
<th scope="col" class="text-right">Percentage</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td scope="row">Draft Publications</td>
<td class="text-right">430</td>
<td class="text-right">33.9%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

Textboxes


R3 Extension: LabelTextBoxFor

Text


(UI-248) Avoid underlining text. Convention on the web is that underlined text is a

hyperlink.

Page Layouts
The following sections describe the typical page type patterns commonly used in
Commission systems.

Search Page
(UI-252) A typical search page should have the following layout:







Breadcrumbs
R4 Page Title
Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core Grid (aka Kendo Grid – Html.Kendo().Grid extension)
o Create [Entity] button using the “mdi-plus-box-outline” icon (left aligned in
Grid’s ToolBar)
o Export to Excel button using the “mdi-file-excel” icon
o Filter button using the “mdi-filter-outline” icon (right-aligned in the Grid’s
Toolbar)
First grid column should contain “Select” button designated as the primary button
that links to the entity’s Details page.

Search Filters
A typical search filter off-canvas sidebar should have the following layout:


The “search” button should be right-aligned at the bottom of the off-canvas
sidebar. The text on the button should say “Search” and use the “mdi-magnify”
icon. The search button should use the “primary” background color.

Summary Page
(UI-253) A Summary Page is only used within an Entity module that uses a Tab Menu. A

typical Summary page should have the following layout:





Breadcrumbs
R4 Page Title, including sub-title
A Partial View containing Tabs (typically named _[MainEntity]Tabs.cshtml)
Summarized data about the entity. Use “cards” to group related data.



Breadcrumbs
R4 Page Title, including sub-title
A partial view containing Tabs (typically named _[MainEntity]Tabs.cshtml). Tabs
are options depending on the complexity of the module/application.
Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core Grid (aka Kendo Grid – Html.Kendo().Grid extension)
o Add [Entity] button using the “mdi-plus-box-outline” icon (left aligned in
Grid’s ToolBar).
 An Add [Entity] button should be used in this case instead of Create
[Entity] because this entity is being added to a parent entity. Create
[Entity] is only used for parent entities.
o Export to Excel button using the “mdi-file-excel” icon
o Filter button using the “mdi-filter-outline” icon (right-aligned in the Grid’s
Toolbar)
First column in the grid should contain a “Select” button that links to the entity’s
Details page.
