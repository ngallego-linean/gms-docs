R4 Solution Architecture

R4 Visual Studio Solution Architecture
Revision Date: October 16, 2025

Every R4 application is composed of five infrastructure projects and at least one presentation project in Visual Studio. All these projects work
together and represent a typical three-layer architecture, Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Access. Essentially when developing an
application using R4, each application becomes a framework that is builds upon the core R4 framework.
The table below explains each of the projects and their purpose.

UI Front-end Project [See Solution Architecture Standards]

Ctc.[AppAcronym].Web.UI.Public

At least one Web Application is included in each project.

Web
Application

Ctc.[AppAcronym].Web.UI.Resources
Ctc.[AppAcronym].Web.UI.{Audience}

If this application targets ONLY internal staff and will NEVER be
exposed to external users, and requires authentication, use the
naming pattern Ctc.[AppAcronym].Web.UI.

OR

If the application will cater to both internal staff and external users,
create two web front end projects using the naming patterns Ctc.
[AppAcronym].Web.UI and Ctc.[AppAcronym].Web.UI.{Audience}.

The following additional projects may be needed depending on the
project needs:



If an internal staff only accessible unauthenticated site is needed,
add a project using the naming pattern Ctc.
