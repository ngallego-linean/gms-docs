R4 Database Standards

Database Security – User Accounts, Roles,
Schemas
Revision Date: September 10, 2025

SQL Server database security is controlled using a combination of the Commission
network user accounts and groups, as well as SQL Server security roles. Network user
accounts are used for database access and permissions validation. SQL Server database
roles are used to manage permissions efficiently. Permissions are added to roles, and
users are assigned to roles.
Any database security needs that do not conform to these standards must be discussed
with the DBA.

USER ACCOUNTS
DB-001
Everyone who needs access to SQL Server should be granted rights using their CTC
network user account. In non-production environments, the
CCTC_CA_GOV\ApplicationDeveloper group is typically added to a SQL Server database
as a user to provide all software developer staff access to that database.
DB-002
Individual Commission network user accounts should not be added to any nonproduction SQL Server database.
DB-003
Each user account or group assigned permissions to a SQL Server database (except for
system accounts) is assigned to one or more SQL Server database roles, depending on
the access that the individual/group is entitled to.
DB-004
The following user accounts are required in your database. The
CCTC_CA_GOV\ApplicationDeveloper Active Directory group has development
permissions on all non-production databases. This group typically is assigned only
read-only access to production databases, although the project lead associated with a
system/database is assigned development access in production.

*The it_developer role in production is limited to read-only.
Connection Strings use SSPI/Integrated Security. The svc-WebApp credentials are entered on the
application pool on the web server. Locally, developers can enter their network account
credentials on the application pool since they have access to SQL Server through the
ApplicationDeveloper Active Directory group.

ROLES
DB-005
The following roles are required in your database. Fixed roles are automatically
available in SQL Server and have the necessary permissions to accomplish common
tasks. The DBA creates user-defined roles that can be customized with permissions.
Please discuss with the DBA if there is a need to make any changes to role permissions.
Role

Description

db_*

Fixed roles starting with "db_" are created and predefined
when the database is created. Do not delete.

public

Fixed database role that is created and predefined when the
database is created. Do not delete.

it_developer

User-defined role used in non-production environments to
manage database objects and for CRUD operations in tables.

SCHEMAS
A SQL Server database schema is a logical way to group objects,
including tables, views, stored procedures, and functions. It is also a way
to implement permissions. The default schema for all database objects is
dbo.
DB-006
The following schemas are required in your database and should not be changed or
dropped. Please discuss with the DBA if there is a need to make changes to schemas.
