Database Static Value Tables (SVTs)
Revision Date: September 10, 2025

A static value table (SVT) is a table with primary keys that are referenced in business
logic and code (i.e., if statements written in code that test for a static value such as 1, 2, or
3). Changes (data and structure) to these tables will impact the system due to code being
written against the values in these tables.
DB-200 Important: These tables should not be modified by business users and need to be
managed by software development staff carefully. Systems have business logic code that
references the values in SVTs, so modifying the data in the tables can cause problems in
the system.
If you have any questions or doubts, please consult with your supervisor, the Systems
Architect, or the DBA.

SVT NAMING
When naming SVTs, consideration should be given to the other steps in
the development process. Keep in mind that you will most likely have to
use the names you give to your tables several times as part of other
objects, such as procedures, triggers, or views, which may all contain
references to the table name. You want to keep the name
straightforward, but as short as possible.
DB-201
Static value table (SVT) names must meet the following criteria:










Suffix with “SVT” (e.g., SatusSVT)
Descriptive
Avoid abbreviations
Singular
Use Pascal Case (first letter in the first word and the first letter of each subsequent
concatenated word are capitalized)
Use alphanumeric characters only
Less than 40 characters
Avoid SQL reserved words (there may be some exceptions)
Do not use prefixes such as “tb” or “tbl”

SVT DESIGN
DB-202
All SVT tables must have the fields listed in the table below including the 5 metadata
fields to keep track of who created and updated the record. The structure defined below
is the standard structure for an SVT table. If your table does not meet the following
design, the table is not an SVT table. Please consult the System Architect if you are
unsure or have any questions.

SVT EXAMPLE
For a practical example of an SVT, consider the typical Status scenario.
In most cases, any table with Status in the name is very likely to be an
SVT table. Let us say our table has the following structure and values
below.
ID

[Standard 5 metadata
fields…]

Let us also say that there are the following business rules around these meaningful
values:


When a record is created, it gets a StatusID value of 1 (Submitted)



When a record is being reviewed, the StatusID is set to 2 (Under Review).



Once the record enters a Status other than 1 (Submitted), it cannot be changed
back to 1 (Submitted).



When a record is accepted, the StatusID is changed to 3 (Accepted), and an email is
sent to the submitter indicating their record was accepted.



When a record is not accepted, the StatusID is changed to 4 (Not Accepted), and an
email is sent to the submitter indicating their record was NOT accepted.



When a record’s StatusID is 3 (Accepted) OR 4 (Not Accepted), the record is
considered “final” and its status can no longer be changed.

With these business rules established, we will need some conditional logic to test for
each value, so an enumeration should be created in your code (C# code). We never
write if statements against hardcoded values (see coding standards).
public enum Status
{
Submitted = 1,
UnderReview = 2,
Accepted = 3,
NotAccepted = 4
}
Note that the enumeration values are equal to the primary keys in the table. Some of
the business logic code may look like the following:
public void SaveAsync(Exception exception)
{
Status exceptionStatus = (Status)exception.StatusID;

}

if (exceptionStatus == Status.Accepted)
{
//send an email indicating that the exception was accepted.
}
else if (exceptionStatus == Status.NotAccepted)
{
//send an email indicating that the inspection was NOT accepted.
}

As you can see from this example, changing the values in the StatusSVT table in the
database can have serious consequences in the system. If PK 3 (Id = 3) in the StatusSVT
was changed from “Accepted” to “On Hold”, the code in the system must change, or an
incorrect email will be sent.
