Database Views

Revision Date: September 10, 2025
A view is a virtual table whose contents are defined by a query. Like a real table, a view
consists of a set of named columns and rows of data. Unless indexed, a view does not
exist as a stored set of data values in a database. The rows and columns of data come
from tables referenced in the query defining the view and are produced dynamically
when the view is referenced.
If you have any questions or doubts, please consult with your supervisor, the Systems
Architect, or the DBA.

VIEW NAMING
When naming views, consideration should be given to the other steps in
the development process. Keep in mind that you will most likely have to
use the names you give to your tables several times as part of other
objects, such as procedures, triggers, or views, which may all contain
references to the table name. You want to keep the name
straightforward, but as short as possible.
DB-300
View names must meet the following criteria:










Descriptive
Avoid abbreviations
Singular
Use Pascal Case (first letter in the first word and the first letter of each subsequent
concatenated word are capitalized)
Only use alphanumeric characters
Less than 40 characters
Avoid SQL reserved words
For views that have the same name as a table (e.g., table name Exception), the
view must be suffixed with “View” (e.g., ExceptionDetail)
For simple views that join one or more tables with no selection criteria, combine
the names of the tables joined. For example, joining the "Institution" and
"Address" table to create a view of Institutions and their respective addresses
should be given a name like "InstititutionAddress".

VIEW DESIGN
The primary purpose of views in R4 systems is to write a SQL statement
only once, which has joins and values from Static Value Tables (SVTs).
Incorporate your frequently required, complicated joins and
calculations into a view so that you do not have to repeat those
joins/calculations in all your queries. Instead, select from the view.
DB-301
You can create views only in the current database. However, the tables and views
referenced by the new view can exist in other databases or even other servers if the
view is defined using distributed queries.
DB-302
View names must follow the rules for identifiers and must be unique for each schema.
Additionally, the name must not be the same as any tables contained by that schema.
DB-303
You cannot define full-text index definitions on views.
DB-304
You cannot create temporary views, and you cannot create views on temporary tables.
DB-305
Do not include the ORDER BY clause in the view.
DB-306
Design views to be flexible and be useful in multiple usage scenarios when possible.
Return all the data and filter the data in the system.
DB-307
If a view is using an SVT table, include the value from the SVT table and the
DisplayOrder column from the SVT table.

Use uppercase for all SQL keywords (SELECT, WHERE, AND, OR, LIKE).
DB-309
Indent code to improve readability.
DB-310
Use parentheses to increase readability.
WHERE (ApplicationStatusID = 1 AND (AddressTypeID = 1 OR AddressTypeID = 2))
DB-311
Use spaces so that expressions read like sentences.
ApplicationStatusID = 1, not ApplicationStatusID=1
DB-312
Do not use SELECT *. Using column names instead of “*” results in reduced disk I/O and
better performance.
DB-313
Use table and field aliases as needed (e.g., when using joins). For single whole word
table names, the first letter of the table name is capitalized.
A for Account, P for Position.

For table names composed of multiple whole words, the alias is composed of the first
letter of each word capitalized.
PGR for PermissionGroupRole, APG for AccountPermissionGroup, PPL for
PortalProfileLocation.

DB-314
Offload tasks, like string manipulations, concatenations, row numbering, case
conversions, type conversions, etc., to the front-end systems (e.g., phone number
formatting, date formatting).
DB-315
Fully qualify table names in JOINs (dbo.TableName).
DB-316
Include non-null values for ID, CreatedByAccountId, CreatedOn,
LastUpdatedByAccountId, LastUpdatedOn, CanBeDeleted columns in the view mapped
to the primary table that the view is returning data from. Depending on the data and
the query, the T-SQL ISNULL function may be necessary to return non-null values for
these columns. If the view is selecting from another view or table that does not support
the R4 table standards, you may need to alias values and use ISNULL to return values
for one or more of these columns.
e.g., …
ISNULL(dbo.Site.UpdatedOn, CAST('1/1/1900 00:00:00' AS datetime)) AS UpdatedOn,

ISNULL(dbo.Site.LastUpdatedByAccountId, 1) AS LastUpdatedByAccountId,
ISNULL(CAST(0 AS Bit), 0) AS CanBeDeleted
…

Note: This will allow a Repository in the R4 data layer to be generated for your view. If
this is not possible, then a Repository will need to be manually written to allow access
to data from this view, or a method will need to be added to an existing Repository
exposing this view’s data to the system.

SCHEMABINDING
DB-317
When creating a view, use SCHEMABINDING to bind the view to the schema of the
underlying table or tables. When SCHEMABINDING is specified, a warning will display
when changing the design of the tables used in the view. For example, if a table has
three columns and all the columns are being used in the view, deleting one of the
columns in the table will result in a warning listing all the views that are bound to the
schema.
Also, when SCHEMABINDING is specified, the underlying tables cannot be deleted
before the view is updated or deleted.

To create a view using SCHEMABINIDING, follow these steps:

1. Create the view
2. Right-click on the view
3. Select Script view as
4. Select ALTER To
5. Select New Query Editor Window
6. After ALTER VIEW [dbo].[vName] add WITH SCHEMABINDING
7. “Execute” to save the view
